---

## Question 3

In OOP, what does the term "encapsulation" refer to?

---

## Question 9

What does the term "abstraction" mean in the context of OOP?

---

## Question 10

How does polymorphism contribute to code flexibility in OOP?

- [ ] By allowing a class to inherit from multiple classes  
- [ ] By providing a consistent interface for different classes  
- [ ] By combining data and methods into a single unit  
- [ ] By restricting access to certain methods
