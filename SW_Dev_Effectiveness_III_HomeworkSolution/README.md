This C++ code [LibrarySystem.cpp](LibrarySystem.cpp) defines a simple library management system with three main classes:

- The Book class represents books in the library. It includes attributes for the title, author, and a flag to indicate if the book is checked out. It provides methods for checking the book's status, checking out the book, and returning it.

- The Patron class represents library patrons and is identified by their names.

- The Library class manages the collection of books and patrons. It provides methods to add books and patrons, check out books to patrons, and return books.

In the main function, an instance of the Library class is created, and various books and patrons are added to the library. Some books are checked out by patrons and then returned.

This code simulates a basic library system, allowing books to be borrowed and returned by patrons.
