# Software Development Effectiveness: Homework 5

## Recap

In the last session, we learned about source control using git. 

In Git's basic workflow, changes are made to your source code, then staged using "git add" and committed with "git commit" along with a meaningful message to capture the changes. This allows for tracking and managing code versions effectively, with the option to create branches for new features or improvements.

## Your Tasks

## Create a GitHub Repository:

- Log in to your GitHub account and create a new repository with a descriptive name (e.g., "BMWs Finest").

## Git Initialization:

- On your local computer, create a directory for your C++ project.
- Initialize a Git repository in this directory using the `git init` command.

## C++ Source Code:

- Write a simple C++ program that does the following:
  - Accepts user input.
  - Performs a basic operation (e.g., addition, subtraction, or multiplication) on the input.
  - Displays the result.
- Save this C++ source code file in your Git repository directory.

## Git Workflow:

- Use Git to manage your source code:
  - Add and commit your initial C++ source code to your local Git repository.
  - Make additional changes to your C++ program.
  - Stage changes with `git add` and commit them with meaningful commit messages using `git commit`.
  - After each significant change, push the committed changes to your GitHub repository using `git push`.

## Git History:

- Use `git log` to view the commit history and ensure that your changes are reflected in your GitHub repository.
