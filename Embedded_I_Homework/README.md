# Embedded: Homework 1

## C Programming Practice Tasks

In the following tasks, you will write C programs to implement various functionalities. These exercises will help you deepen your programming skills in C and apply different concepts.

## Yours Tasks

**Task 1: Temperature Conversion**

Write a C program that can convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The user first selects the desired conversion unit:

Choose:
a) Celsius -> Fahrenheit
b) Fahrenheit -> Celsius

Use the following formulas for conversion:
- 째C = (째F - 32) * 5/9 (from Fahrenheit to Celsius)
- 째F = 째C * 1.8 + 32 (from Celsius to Fahrenheit)

**Task 2: Calculate Age**

Create a C program that asks the user for their first name, last name, and year of birth. The program outputs the full name along with the age in parentheses. The year 2023 is fixed as the current year.

Example input:
<blockquote>
First name: Max<br>
Last name: Mustermann<br>
Year of birth: 1990<br>
</blockquote>

Output:
<blockquote>Max Mustermann (33 years old)</blockquote>
<br>

**Task 3: Square Root Calculation**

Write a C program that can calculate square roots of numbers. Use the `sqrt` function from the `math.h` library. The user inputs a number, and the program outputs its square root.

**Task 4: Electricity Cost Calculator**

Develop an electricity cost calculator. The user inputs the daily consumption in kWh and the electricity price per kWh. The program calculates the annual consumption and costs and displays them.

**Task 5: Number System Converter**

Write a C program that can convert decimal numbers to octal (base 8) and hexadecimal (base 16). The user inputs a decimal number, and the program outputs its equivalent octal and hexadecimal representations.

Example:

Input:
Number to convert: 26

Output:
Octal: 32
Hexadecimal: 1A
