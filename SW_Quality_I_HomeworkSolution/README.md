# Clean Code: Homework 1 - Solution

## Driving Towards Code Excellence: Navigating Clean Code in Automotive Software

## Your Tasks

1. Write a short paragraph highlighting the connections between clean code and automotive performance. Explain how applying clean code principles can enhance software reliability and efficiency for vehicles. Use your own words.

2. Identify three instances of design anomalies in a real-world automotive software application. Briefly describe each anomaly and its potential impact on the software's performance and maintainability.

3. Identify and describe design smells:
Choose any software system you are familiar with (it doesn't have to be automotive-related) and identify three instances of design smells within the system. Describe each design smell in detail, explaining why it is considered a design issue and how it could potentially impact the maintainability, scalability, or overall quality of the software.


__Task 1:__

Clean code and automotive performance share a fundamental link that goes beyond the lines of code. Just as a well-optimized engine ensures a vehicle's optimal functioning, clean code principles improve software reliability and efficiency in automotive applications. 

Clean code promotes organized, easily understandable codebases, reducing the risk of errors and enhancing maintainability. Just as a well-maintained vehicle runs smoother and consumes less fuel, clean code paves the way for software that performs reliably, consumes fewer system resources, and adapts seamlessly to future enhancements.

__Task 2:__

In a real-world automotive software application, design anomalies can emerge in various ways. One instance could be an overly complex module responsible for handling sensor inputs, affecting real-time data processing. This anomaly might lead to delays in critical decision-making processes, impacting the vehicle's response time and safety. 

Another anomaly might involve tightly coupled components handling different vehicle systems, potentially causing difficulties when upgrading or adding new features, thus hindering maintainability. 

A third anomaly could be inadequate error handling, resulting in unexpected system failures that impact the overall reliability and user experience of the vehicle's software.

__Task 3:__

The first design smell revolves around the use of excessively long methods. These lengthy methods tend to intertwine multiple functionalities, making the code harder to read, understand, and maintain. As a result, the risk of introducing errors and the difficulty of adapting the software for future changes increase significantly.

The second design smell pertains to the duplication of code across various locations within the codebase. This redundancy not only inflates the size of the codebase but also poses a challenge when trying to update or fix a specific piece of functionality. Any modification to the duplicated code needs to be repeated across all instances, which can lead to inconsistencies and a higher likelihood of errors creeping in.

Lastly, the third design smell involves the excessive use of global variables. Relying heavily on global variables can make the code less modular and harder to maintain. It can lead to unexpected side effects and challenges in tracking how and where these variables are being modified throughout the codebase.
