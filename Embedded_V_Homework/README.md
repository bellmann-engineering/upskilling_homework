# Embedded: Homework 5

## C++ Programming Practice Tasks

In recent modules, we explored the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a paradigm in software development. OOP helps us organize code like real-world things, making it easier to use, reuse, and manage. We learned about concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, all of which are essential for creating robust and structured software systems.

For this homework, you'll be tasked with creating a class based on a UML diagram. Your assignment involves defining methods and member variables within the class, as well as working directly with objects.

Keep in mind that OOP is only available in C++, so we'll be using the g++ compiler instead of gcc for compiling.

## Car Rental System Exercise

Imagine we are developing a basic car rental system. We'll start by defining a class named Car to represent individual cars. 

**Basic Exercise:**

The Car class should have the following features:

1. **Private data members:**
   - `brand` (string): Represents the brand of the car.
   - `model` (string): Specifies the model of the car.
   - `year` (int): Denotes the manufacturing year of the car.
   - `rented` (bool): Indicates whether the car is currently rented.

2. **Public member functions:**
   - **Constructor:** Initializes the `brand`, `model`, and `year` of the car. The `rented` status should be set to `false` by default.
   - `rentCar()`: Sets the rented status of the car to `true` if it's available for rent.
   - `returnCar()`: Sets the rented status of the car back to `false`.

Use the following UML class diagram as a template:

In the `main` function of your program:

1. **Introduce the Car Rental System:** Provide an overview of the program's purpose and its simulation of a car rental system.
2. **Create Car Objects:** Generate an array or vector of `Car` objects to represent the available cars in the rental system.

**Hint**: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector

3. **Interactive Rental Process:** Allow users to select cars for renting or returning based on their availability.

4. **Display Status:** Display the updated status of cars after each rental/return action.
