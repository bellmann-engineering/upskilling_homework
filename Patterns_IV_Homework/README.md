# Patterns: Homework 4

In our recent session, we covered anti-patterns and their consequences, specifically focusing on Developer Anti-patterns, Architectural Anti-patterns, and Management Anti-patterns in software development.

## Exercise

## Introduction
Please review your recent code or a codebase you are familiar with to identify potential anti-patterns. 

## How-to
1. **Select a Codebase:**
   - Choose a codebase you have worked on in the last few weeks or one that you are familiar with.

2. **Review Recent Changes:**
   - If applicable, review any code changes you have made in the last weeks.

3. **Look for Anti-Patterns:**
     Analyze the codebase specifically for indicators of Developer Anti-patterns 
	 (such as code duplication and excessive global state), 
	 Architectural Anti-patterns (including long and complex methods or classes, inconsistent naming conventions), 
	 and Management Anti-patterns (e.g. overengineering).

4. **Document Findings:**
   - Create a list of identified potential anti-patterns, including the file names and specific code snippets where applicable.

5. **Reflection:**
   - Reflect on the impact of these potential anti-patterns on the codebase. Consider how they might affect readability, maintainability, and overall software quality.

6. **Consider Refactoring:**
   - Think about potential refactoring solutions for each identified anti-pattern. How could the code be improved to follow best practices?
