# Software Development Effectiveness: Homework 2

## Recap

In the last session, we learned about the importance of code reviews in the software development process. 
We discussed why code reviews are crucial for maintaining code quality, preventing bugs, and collaboration within a team. 
We also explored the roles of authors and reviewers in the code review process and the significance of maintaining an open and constructive mindset when giving and receiving feedback.

## Your Tasks

Task 1: Rules for the Author
In the first task, your goal is to create a set of rules or guidelines that authors should follow when preparing their code for review. These rules should help authors improve the quality of their code and make the review process more effective. Think about what authors can do to ensure their code is review-ready and how they can approach feedback in a constructive way.

Task 2: Rules for the Reviewer
For the second task, your objective is to formulate a set of rules or best practices for reviewers during a code review. These rules should focus on how reviewers can provide valuable feedback, maintain a positive and respectful tone, and promote a collaborative atmosphere. Consider the importance of offering constructive criticism and asking relevant questions when reviewing someone else's code.
