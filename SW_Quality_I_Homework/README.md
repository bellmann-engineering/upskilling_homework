# Clean Code: Homework 1

## Driving Towards Code Excellence: Navigating Clean Code in Automotive Software

In the bustling hub of automotive innovation, a team of dedicated engineers and programmers worked tirelessly to craft cutting-edge software solutions for the vehicles of tomorrow. However, amid their remarkable achievements, a challenge emerged â€“ their code was becoming as convoluted as a rush-hour traffic jam. Bugs were causing detours, and implementing updates felt like a never-ending road trip. The time had come for a transformative journey toward writing cleaner, more efficient code tailored to the demands of automotive software.

Ok - let's get serious. While this may sound a bit extreme, it is rooted in a genuine core that forms the basis of our work. 

## Your Tasks

1. Write a short paragraph highlighting the connections between clean code and automotive performance. Explain how applying clean code principles can enhance software reliability and efficiency for vehicles. Use your own words.

2. Identify three instances of design anomalies in a real-world automotive software application. Briefly describe each anomaly and its potential impact on the software's performance and maintainability.

3. Identify and describe design smells:
Choose any software system you are familiar with (it doesn't have to be automotive-related) and identify three instances of design smells within the system. Describe each design smell in detail, explaining why it is considered a design issue and how it could potentially impact the maintainability, scalability, or overall quality of the software.
