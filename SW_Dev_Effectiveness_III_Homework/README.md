# Software Development Effectiveness: Homework 3

## Recap

In the last session, we learned about the benefits of pair programming in the software development process. 
We discussed why pair programming can be benifical and how it is done. 

## Your Tasks

In this exercise, you and your partner will work together to design and implement a basic calculator in C++. 
The goal is to practice pair programming.

Part 1: Role Assignment 

    Decide who will be the initial Driver and Navigator. You will switch roles during the exercise.

Part 2: Pair Programming - Library System Implementation

    Collaboratively design and implement the C++ library system. The key steps include:

    a. Define classes: Create classes for books, patrons, and library transactions. Consider attributes and methods for each class.

    b. Implement object interactions: Define how books can be checked out, returned, and how transactions are recorded.

    c. User interface: Develop a basic user interface to interact with the library system, allowing users to check out, return, and view information about books and patrons.

    d. Test the library system: Create a program that uses the library system classes to perform actions like checking out and returning books. Ensure that the interactions work as expected.

    After a suitable period, switch roles between Driver and Navigator to ensure both partners contribute to the design and implementation.
